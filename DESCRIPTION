Description: Feature selection aims to identify and remove redundant,
    irrelevant and noisy variables from high-dimensional datasets.
    Selecting informative features affects the subsequent 
    classification and regression analyses by improving their overall 
    performances. Several methods have been proposed to perform 
    feature selection: most of them relies on univariate statistics,
    correlation, entropy measurements or the usage of backward/forward
    regressions. Herein, we propose an efficient, robust and fast method
    that adopts stochastic optimization approaches for high-dimensional.
    GARS is an innovative implementation of a  genetic 
    algorithm that selects robust features in high-dimensional and
    challenging datasets.
